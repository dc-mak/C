/* C's struct layout must be in the order specified but the total size may be
 * padded to make it fit 4/8 byte multiples (32/64 bit)
 * so on a 64-bit machine, this struct of 1032 bytes is padded to 1088 and so
 * 1088*100 is the size of the file
 *
 * Although making conn global clears up code a bit, it introduces several
 * problems in keeping track of whether or not memory has been initialised
 * 
 * i could have definitely put conn and db on the stack instead of the heap as global
